# Your first day on the R&D team

Welcome to the team!

Your first day will be all about getting access to our systems and taking them for a spin.

But before we get started, you will need to:

- [ ] Have your photo for the website taken. 
- [ ] Set up your desk and get your computer up and running.

Once that is done we can start getting you on our systems.

## Getting access to our applications

The following application help us stay productive. You should get access to:

- [ ] `Gmail`. You email should already have a bunch of unread mail that invite you to create accounts on the systems described below.
- [ ] `Gcal`. You should already have access to this, but please check. 
- [ ] `1Password`. This is our password manager.
- [ ] `Slack`. This is our messaging tool.
- [ ] `Confluence`. This is what we use for internal documents such as meeting notes and road maps.
- [ ] `YouTrack`. This is our task management tool.
- [ ] `ClickUp`. Our CEO uses this to assign tasks that are not part of `YouTrack` and don't follow sprints.
- [ ] `DropBox` and `Boxcryptor`. This is where we store files that are not part of the production system or stored on the Data Warehouse.
- [ ] the `RnD` team on GitHub. This is where we will keep all of our data science projects.

Now that you have access to our systems its time to put them to use.

## Using GitHub

We use GitHub to collaborate on our projects. If you are not already familiar with Git expect to spend some time getting the hang of it. Don't be afraid to ask one of your colleagues for help completing the tasks below.

- [ ] Clone the [ds-tools](https://github.com/rehfeldmedical/ds-tools) repository. This repository contains config files for Jupyter Notebooks. Follow the instructions given in the repository's `README` file.
- [ ] Make a `Pull Request` to one of the data science repositories. Never done a `Pull Request` before? No worries, we can walk you through it.

## Using YouTrack

We do 2 week sprints. `YouTrack` helps us plan the work and keep track of our progress throughout the sprint.

- [ ] Go to the [RnD backlog](https://makewise.myjetbrains.com/youtrack/issues/RD?q=project:%20%7BResearch%20and%20Development%7D%20Stage:%20Backlog) in `YouTrack` and look at the stories. We should already have some good options for you.
- [ ] Assign yourself to a tick and add it to the [RnD agile board](https://makewise.myjetbrains.com/youtrack/agiles/).


## Using Confluence

We generate a fair amount of document during meetings. To structure the information we use `Confluence`. 

- [ ] Read the road map or product requirement for the project you will be working on. This will give you an idea of where we are headed and how your work will contribute to reaching our goals. E.g. have a look at [this requirement](https://makewisedk.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/RD/pages/42926211/The+ECG+Analyzer)
- [ ] Edit one of the documents in `Confluence`.
- [ ] Create a documents in `Confluence`.

## Final note
With this you have been exposed to all of our systems. The last thing to note that our on boarding process is in development. We would appreciate it if you write down some thoughts on the process over the next two weeks. This will help us do better next time, thanks!
