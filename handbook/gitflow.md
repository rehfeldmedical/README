# Github workflow

We use the [git flow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) approach to branching, with peer-review on all changes. We rebase feature branches, and we squash to a single commit before fast-forward merging back into master/develop.

### Naming branches
Each application-related repo should have following branches:

* `master`: Production, each version deployed should be tagged. Changes merged into this branch should ideally only come from `develop` branch or hotfix branches.
* `develop`: Main development branch that should be fairly stable. Anything merged into this branch must be peer reviewed first.
* hotfix branches: For hotfixes that will go directly into `master`. They should be named after issue id with `hotfix` prefix, e.g. `hotfix-SCAUT-321`.
* feature branches: For work that will be merged into develop. They should be named after issue id, e.g. `SCAUT-123`.

### Issue lifecycle

![Issue lifecycle](issue_lifecycle.png?raw=true)

* Issues begin as **To Do**, when added to a sprint.
* Issues move to **In Progress** when you create an issue-keyed branch (e.g., `git checkout -b SCAUT-123`) and push it to remote origin.
* Once you are done working on the issue, you open a Pull Request (PR) and it goes through Peer Review.
* Issues move to **QA** when the PR is merged successfully.
* Issues must be manually moved from **QA** to **Done** once the internal QA process has concluded successfully.
* If **QA** reveals bugs related to an issue from a merged PR, new bug issues may be created and added to the **Backlog** (or **Sprint** if critical enough).
* Issues also move to **Done** if the PR is closed (if the PR is no longer needed or useful)

### Git commit rules

A git commit must make sense on its own, as a stand-alone unit of change. Additionally, there are some restrictions on how to write commits to ensure a consistent style and form:

* Commit text and messages are written in the current tense, e.g., "Remove logout button from application", not "Removed logout button"
* Commit titles must refer to the issue they relate to by prefixing the issue id e.g., `SCAUT-123 Remove logout button`
* Commit bodies are unnecessary if the title says it all (e.g., `SCAUT-123 Remove logout button from profile` is enough if that is all that changed).
* Commit bodies must generally be a list of dash-prefixed items that briefly and specifically ensure you understand exactly what has changed. For example:
	* Bad commit body line: "Deprecate unneeded API route" (no dash, and too vague)
	* Good commit body line: "- Remove /api/v2/patient/foo"
	* Bad commit body line: "- Refactored patient search" (past tense, too vague)
	* Good commit body line: "- Modify searchPatients to always filter based on current users Clinic access"
	* Bad commit body line: "- Add getPatientProfilesInBulk because it is useful for the web API to be able to fetch them like this" (unnecessarily verbose; no need to specify **why**)
	* Good commit body line: "- Add getPatientProfilesInBulk to fetch multiple profiles at once"

**Notes on working with git and the git history**

* Commit often locally, and continually pull in changes from the parent branch by git pull → git rebase -i, rebasing your local branch on top of the history of the parent branch. Do not merge the parent branch into your branch - ever.
* Avoid long-running branches like the plague, as they tend to become harder and harder to work on. Unless you have a **very good reason**, a branch generally shouldn't last longer than couple of days. Big changes or features should ideally be split into self contained units.
* Don't squash your PR into a single commit before the review has concluded; it's useful for the reviewer to see how the PR got to it's current state.
* Once a PR has been accepted, there is some cleanup work to do:
	* There should be no intermediary commits, no commits with typo’s or bad descriptions, and **all** commits should refer to an issue.
	* As a general rule, squash the entire branch into as few commits as possible, each of which relate to its own issue. **Almost all branches should just be a single commit**. The only commit(s) allowed that don't relate to an issue are trivial changes like removing dead code or reformatting, which importantly do not change code functionality at all.
	* Ensure that the PR title and body contains the same information that the commit does, and that each commit adheres to the "Git commit rules" above.

### Example
Suppose we have a fictional issue called SCAUT-123. Applying the above could look like the following:

1. Create a new branch for the issue: `git checkout -b SCAUT-123`
2. Do a bunch of work on the feature.
3. Once the work is done, open a pull request for the issue: `git pull-request` or open one via the GitHub UI.
	1. PR title: `SCAUT-123 Remove logout button`
	2. PR body:
	
	```
	- Remove logout button in profile menu
	- Fix profile menu margins
	```
4. Assign reviewer(s) on Github. For non-trivial changes, there should be two reviewers. The issue will now undergo "Peer Review" as per the above diagram.
5. Once the PR has been accepted, we must now clean up the commits.
	1. Pull newest develop: `git checkout develop && git pull`
	2. Rebase our PR branch against develop: `git checkout SCAUT-123 && git rebase -i develop`
	3. In the interactive rebase, we `squash` all the commits into a single commit. This will let us interactively edit the commit message, which we clean up and ensure it follows the above rules on commit messages.
	4. Afterwards, check that the history looks clean and proper with `git log`
6. Merge the PR into develop: `git checkout develop && git merge SCAUT-123 && git push`
	- As an alternative, you can use the Rebase and Merge option in the Github GUI under the Pull Request.
