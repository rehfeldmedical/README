# Development environment

The setup of development environment is one of the most important steps for all new members of the tech team. Our aim is that this process is as painless as possible, but at the same time the result should be an environment with full capabilities for running and testing the codebase.

Following are the steps to set up the local environment:

* [Setup OpenShift cluster](#setup-openshift-cluster)
    * [Example app](#example-app)
    * [Shut down the cluster](#shut-down-the-cluster)
* [Ansible setup](#ansible-setup)

## Setup OpenShift cluster

We deploy the applications to OpenShift cluster. OpenShift comes in two versions: [open source](https://www.okd.io/) and [enterprise](https://www.openshift.com/). We use the open source version and it's relatively complex to setup properly. To make this process easier, we use the [Minishift](https://github.com/minishift/minishift) tool. Minishift will take care of setting up the VM with CentOS and deploying OpenShift cluster, as well as `oc` command line tool.

Following are the steps to set up your local OpenShift cluster:

* Setup the virtualization environment. This is OS dependent, so check the [Minishift docs](https://docs.okd.io/latest/minishift/getting-started/setting-up-virtualization-environment.html) what needs to be done for a particular OS. For macOS:

```
$ brew install docker-machine-driver-xhyve
$ sudo chown root:wheel $(brew --prefix)/opt/docker-machine-driver-xhyve/bin/docker-machine-driver-xhyve
$ sudo chmod u+s $(brew --prefix)/opt/docker-machine-driver-xhyve/bin/docker-machine-driver-xhyve    
```
* Install Minishift. This is also OS dependent, see the [relevant documentation](https://docs.okd.io/latest/minishift/getting-started/installing.html). For macOS:

```
$ brew cask install minishift
```
* Start minishift. The process may take awhile the first time as it needs to download CentOS, OpenShift, ... So, grab a coffee.

```
$ minishift start
```

* As part of installation process, the `oc` command line tool is also installed. Add it to your `$PATH` environment variable. To check the path, use `minishift oc-env` command:

```
$ minishift oc-env
export PATH="/Users/jang/.minishift/cache/oc/v3.11.0/darwin:$PATH"
# Run this command to configure your shell:
# eval $(minishift oc-env)
```

* Run `oc status` to verify that the cluster is running.

**Congratulations!** You have now a running OpenShift cluster on your laptop.

#### Example app
Let's deploy rabbitMQ as an example of using OpenShift cluster:

* Tell the cluster to download and run rabbitMQ docker image (with rabbit's admin console):

```
$ oc new-app rabbitmq:management-alpine
```

* Check the logs:

```
$ oc logs -f svc/rabbitmq
```

* Expose the admin console to be accessible from outside of cluster:
```
$ oc expose service rabbitmq --name=rabbitmq-admin --port 15672
```

* Use `oc status` to verify that the new route is available. See example output:

```
$ oc status
In project My Project (myproject) on server https://192.168.64.2:8443

http://rabbitmq-admin-myproject.192.168.64.2.nip.io to pod port 15672
  dc/rabbitmq deploys istag/rabbitmq:management-alpine
    deployment #1 deployed 37 minutes ago - 1 pod
```

* Use a browser to open rabbitMQ console using the http address from `oc status` command. If everything worked correctly, then you should see the login form and you can use `guest/quest` to login and inspect your rabbitMQ instance.

#### Shut down the cluster
Let's delete the rabbitMQ example application and then stop the cluster:

```
$ oc delete svc rabbitmq
$ oc delete dc rabbitmq
$ minishift stop
```
