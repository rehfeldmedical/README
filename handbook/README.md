# Developer Handbook

Welcome to the tech team! We hope that you will have great experience as part of the team. 

The Developer Handbook contains information to get you up and running with the codebase and the way the tech team works.

### Communication
General rule we try to follow is to be nice to each other. We developers tend to be opinionated, which is good. But try not to be religious about things - there's a reason a colleague disagrees with you.

Written communication is generally preferred form of communication. Any meetings and brainstorming sessions should also be summarized in a written form. This way, the team members not present (vacation, remote working, ...) can still be kept in the loop. This doesn't mean that you are discouraged to just ask something of a person sitting next to you. Of course you can and you should, but most of work-related information/decisions/etc should end up in a written form somewhere.
 
We use Slack for direct communication and especially [#dev channel](https://scaut.slack.com/messages/dev) for tech oriented topics.
