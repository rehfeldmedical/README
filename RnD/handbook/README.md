## We use Jupyter Notebooks for reporting

Jupyter Notebooks are great for Data Science, but there are some pit-falls that one has to stay clear of. Joel Grus has given a talk on [why he doesn't like Notebooks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jiPeIFXb6U). We believe that most of the down-sides can be avoided if you keep a couple of things in mind:
1. Notebooks are mainly for reporting. The final output of the notebook will be a HTML page with the code cells stripped away. They will be read or used for impromptu presentations.
1. Notebooks produce insights, not code.
1. If the notebooks are interdependent, you are doing it wrong.

## Code quality is important

Even though we are not Software Engineers we will be producing a lot of code. This code need to be readable and understandable for exactly the same reasons Software Engineers write strive to write readable code. 

We have a couple of books at the office that can help you: [Code Complete](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4845.Code_Complete?ac=1&from_search=true), [Clean Code](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3735293-clean-code?ac=1&from_search=true), and [The Pragmatic Programmer](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4099.The_Pragmatic_Programmer?ac=1&from_search=true). If you haven't already read one of these or similar books, we recommend having a look at them.

## Data visualization is important

Most of the time, the results of all our analysis will boil down to a couple of figures. These figures should be produced with care.
