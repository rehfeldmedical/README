# Sprint process

Engineering works in two week sprints. Sprints begin with a planning meeting, where we allocate already-grooomed and prioritized issues into the new sprint and break them down further (if necessary). We don't currently estimate tasks in terms of time or assign story points.

At the end of the sprint there is a sprint retrospective, where we look back on the past two weeks in terms of what went well, and what we could improve. The main purpose of this is to look at process and _why_ something went wrong, so that we can avoid making similar mistakes going forward. It's not a blame game.

Issues become groomed/prioritized in sprint grooming meetings, which are held at regular intervals according to necessity (right now, every two weeks). The purpose of grooming is to ensure that issues have enough detail and are clear in their purpose, and that we consistently remember to prioritize and re-arrange issues according to our current situation.

We may formalize this process more as the team grows larger and our needs change, but we are strong believers in only introducing process/overhead when or if it serves a clear and necessary purpose - not just for the sake of process itself.
