# Sprint process

Engineering works in two week sprints. Sprints begin with a planning meeting, where we allocate already-grooomed, prioritized and 
estimated issues into the new sprint. Issue estimations are re-assessed if need be, issues deemed too complex are withheld and
broken down to be part of a later sprint, and issues are added until we feel there are enough small + big estimate task(s) per
person in a sprint.

We do a mid-way sprint standup, which serves to do course corrections, identify blocks and/or provide help.

At the end of the sprint there is a sprint retrospective, where we look back on the past two weeks in terms of what went well, and
what we could improve. The main purpose of this is to look at process and _why_ something went wrong or well, so that we can avoid
or encourage appropriately. Note: It's not a blame game!

Sprint grooming is held at regular intervals according to necessity, not necessarily tied to the sprint cycle per se. The 
purpose of grooming is to ensure that issues are: (i) clear, (ii) detailed as needed, (iii) broken down as much as makes sense,
(iv) estimated and (v) prioritized.
