# Developer Handbook

Welcome to Engineering! We're glad to have you onboard and look forward to working with you.

The Developer Handbook contains information to get you up and running with the codebase and the way the tech team works.

### Communication
Developers are opinionated - which is great. But try not to be religious about things, as there is usually a reason that a colleague may disagree with you.

We prefer asynchronous communication forms like Slack and e-mail to verbal communication, unless there is a good reason such
as a meeting, a brainstorming session, wanting to draw on a whiteboard and so on. This lets us work uninterrupted as much as
possible, despite being situated in an open office. This doesn't mean that you are discouraged from asking something of a person
sitting next to you. Of course you can and you should, when it makes sense to do so. Just keep in mind that it costs time when
someone is interrupted in what they are doing - as opposed to being able to tackle your question at an opportune moment.

As much as possible, meetings should also be summarized in written form so that others can follow what goes on even when not present. 

We use Slack for direct communication and especially [#dev channel](https://scaut.slack.com/messages/dev) for tech oriented topics.
