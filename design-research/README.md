# Welcome to Design Research

In Design Research we design features that have a positive impact for both patients and clinicians. 

A core part of our work is to actively engage end-users and other stakeholders throughout the design process. 

This means that we combine ethnographic fieldwork, co-design and prototyping: We move between exploring, experimenting and evaluating. 

*Exploring* means that we visit patients in their homes or clinicians in the clinic. We observe their daily life or work and talk about their problems and needs. We also engage them in asking “what if” and together we explore and envision possible better futures with the SCAUT platform and how we can help realising it. 

*Experimenting* means that we sketch, create mock-ups and prototypes to get feedback on early versions of possible new features. Here, we collaborate closely with Engineering around development and implementation of new features. 

*Evaluating* means that we use empirical data as input for re-design. For example, if we launch a new feature on the SCAUT platform we combine user feedback from phone calls with patients (Support) with input from clinicians using SCAUT.  	

The overall process is organised under the SCAUT Living Lab. See more below.
