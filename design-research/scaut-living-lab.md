# What is the SCAUT Living Lab?

A living lab is an environment in which we formally involve patients in the on-going research and development of a project.
By involving patients formally we are able to engage them closely in design research by e.g., contacting them about new features or 
about input for research. For example, in the SCAUT Living Lab we conducted a sub-study around the SCAUT Medication List patients can
access in our smartphone app. We compared the medication list that patients create in the SCAUT app, with the list in the Danish
electronic medical record (FMK). We also reached out to patients to help us understand their use of the SCAUT Medication List, asking 
them what they found useful/not useful. The feedback we received served as input for re-desining and improving the medication list.

### On-boarding 
When a patient is on-boarded onto the SCAUT platform they also become a part of the SCAUT Living Lab. Patients sign a written consent 
form that allows us to store and analyze their patient-provided input as part of the research we do. They are also informed about how 
to actively participate in the living lab. Currently a research nurse approaches the patient, provides them with information about 
SCAUT and helps them install our app on their phone.
