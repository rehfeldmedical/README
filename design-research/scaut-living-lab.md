# What is the SCAUT Living Lab?

Organzing design in under a living lab is essentially about formally involved patients in on-going research and development of the SCAUT platform.

When patients are on-boarded, they informed about their active participation and they give written consent. It is currenlty a research nurse that approach patients, provide them with information about SCAUT and install the app on their phone. 

By involving patients formally we are able to engage patients closely in design research by e.g. contacting them about new features or about input for research. For example, we conducted a sub-study around the SCAUT Medication List in the SCAUT app. We compared the medication list that patients create in the SCAUT app with the list in the electronic medical record. We contacted patients about their use of the SCAUT Medication List and asked them what they find useful/not useful. The feedback served as input for re-desining and improving the medication list.
