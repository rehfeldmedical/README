# Roundtable
The purpose of the roundtable meeting is to align all of us with what is going on in the company. 

As we are a highly interdisciplinary team with different but overlapping areas of work, staying aligned towards a cohesive vision and having a good idea of what is going on in the company are important. This helps minimize friction and provides context across work boundaries.

The meeting has two parts:

1. Personal: a 30 minute section for what we each have been doing the past 2 weeks and will be doing over the next 2 weeks. Aim for 3-4 minutes or less, each.
1. Roadmap: a 30 minute section for looking forward from a company perspective.

To ensure the meeting stays on-track, each of us will prepare by adding relevant bullet-points to the retrospective and roadmap slides prior to the meeting. Adding points to the roadmap is optional, but there should always be _something_ worth mentioning as part of the personal section.
