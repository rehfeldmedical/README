# Demo
The purpose of the demo meeting is to show new work, both prototype work and finished features that have recently gone into production.

The meeting lasts for up to an hour, and is divided into 3 20 minute sections: (i) Design Research, (ii) Data Science, and (iii) Engineering.

To avoid wasting time and to ensure the meeting runs smoothly, those with a demo should be ready and prepared to go through it by the time the meeting starts.

When demo'ing, remember to first provide the context and relevance, so everyone understands what they are being shown. Think of it like doing a short pitch at a meetup :)

There aren't always things to demo, and that's absolutely fine! But remember that it's often very rewarding to show off your awesome work, and can give important insights to do so. Importantly it doesn't have to be super polished to be worth showing off.
